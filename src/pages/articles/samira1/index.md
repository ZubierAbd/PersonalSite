summary: "I remember I started writing this story almost five years ago, my first week at my first proper job. Naturally I was underutilized because I was new and they couldn't find anything for me to do. So I started writing this story. Due to it's length, I am breaking down this story into several parts. This is part one. "

Tomorrow I will be a headline. Okay, maybe not a headline but at least I will be squeezed somewhere within the first few pages of the morning paper. Honors student at BRAC University commits suicide – won’t that make for a nice bit of breakfast reading?
What do you say about a girl who kills herself? I imagine there would be a nice photo of me in the picture – a pretty girl with silky black hair and round doe eyes. The picture chosen will be one which is the most flattering towards me. The unspoken impetus behind it would be showing how much innocence and potential was lost. Kind words would be said about me – people I barely know will tell the world how full of life I was and how I was taken away much too soon.
And so it goes.

It's a funny thing about humanity – we always say nice things about people after they die. We idolize the dead and simultaneously we render whole beings with hopes and dreams and personalities into an epigraph and nothing more.

What will be on most people's minds though is why I did it. They will wonder how I have come to such ruin. The media will speculate and eventually some semblance of a narrative will emerge, true or not. Then with the underlying curiosity in people's minds banished, the world will move on. Till the next grotesquerie that captures their attention.

Thus, with happenstance and rumor leading the dance, the truth will die a cold ignominious death.

I want to change that. I want to elucidate each and every reason that I have to extinguish my existence.

I told myself I would stop smoking but I haven’t been able to shake the habit. What does it matter now anyway? It’s not like I will live long enough to come down with lung cancer. So I am going to light another cigarette up, enjoying that burning heat and that ineffable weight of the smoke as it goes down my lungs and finish writing this.

My last farewell.

I guess some proper introduction is needed. My name is Samira. You’ve probably seen pictures of me and even the occasional video of me posted in those sites that you dare not tell the women in your life that you visit. You’ve probably stared slack jawed at me, on the bed, doing intimate things which were never meant for other eyes and you probably felt a sick sense of triumph at that. Don’t lie, I know you did. But then, of course the thought processes in your head temporarily shut down, as the blood rushes to the opposite end of your body. After you finished with your sick perversion, you would look again at me, as a last reminder and think of me as some poor slut or a whore, someone who deserved it.

Everyone makes mistakes and most of the time; they will blame anyone but themselves. They will blame the capricious hands of fate or genetics or circumstances when they do something incredibly stupid. At the end of my life, I won't do that. I’ll admit that I've made my share of mistakes and each of them has brought me here, to you reading this letter written in my vaguely legible script and me writing it, sitting here in my room with the haze of cigarette smoke whirling in the air like a promise. And the seventeen tablets of Partesiol that I've ingested which should do the trick.

The worst thing about a mistake is that you have to live with it. You also have to live with that look in people’s eyes, the look that says ‘You deserve everything that happens.’
It’s that look which lets you know who your friends are.

After all, good girls don’t let themselves be filmed right? Only a whore would do that. The toughest thing about being a woman is being judged as a whore just for being yourself. You’ve seen my video perhaps or after this you most certainly will and then you will simultaneously lust for me and despise me. You will hate me because I am all of the things you do not have and you will lust for me for obvious reasons. And in the end, to justify the erroneous behavior that you are doing, the severe breach of privacy that you are committing, you will say…….that it was my fault.

I am none of these things; a person’s life cannot be condensed into such a sound bite. I will try to explain everything that happened in the hopes that my pathos, and the pathos of so many people in this world – the women, the children, the beautiful and the damned – be understood.
Perhaps I will fail. Does it matter anymore? Successful people don’t swallow a bottle of painkillers before writing a suicide note, do they?

I have five cigarettes left now. It took longer for me to get started than I thought it would but I think I can finish the rest of the story soon.

**First Cigarette**

First Cigarette:
A cigarette is the best friend of someone who is depressed. Each breath brings you closer to the inevitable oblivion that you so crave and that you feel you deserve. It gives you comfort, it gives you stimulation and it gives you a reprieve from the unbearable weight of living. You know?
I thought dying would be a bit harder – the pills I have taken, bought from one of those guys who you can find in every university canteen who will bring you whatever you want for the right price, seems to be working. I don’t know. I feel a dull kind of resignation to everything, as though I am an actor in a play and my part is finally over and I can get off. Exit stage right.
Honestly, I am not sure where to start with this. I’ve given you the introduction, just like I have been taught to do by all of my composition teachers that have been paid to teach me these things. You know how it goes right? Intro – 3 paragraphs of body – conclusion; but real life cannot be organized into such neat little quintiles; I’ll try my best though.

A funny thing is about mistakes is that they compound. One small mistake now can lead to much bigger ones in the future until all is left is ruin.

I was thirteen years old when we moved to Dhaka. I was pretty – stereotypically Bengali pretty; white skin, long straight black hair, you get the general idea. To those girls who dream of being a bit more like the cultural ideal of beauty imbibed in the Bengali unconscious, don’t. Being beautiful is a curse – it makes you a target. It brings you pain.

Looking at the mirror perched on my desk; I can see the ghost of that girl looking back at me with sad, haunted eyes. She looks at me with disappointment, with regret and I wish - how I wish I could tell her that I was sorry for leading her to such a life, for turning a child of such promise and hope into myself.

When we moved to Dhaka, my father had started a new job, working as some sort of high level official in the government. He was an engineer by trade and a loving father, who was never home because he was always working. I was raised by my mother and our kaajer bua, a lovely gnarled wizened old lady named Saleha. They loved me and I loved them and things were perfect.

I was enrolled in a local school, the name of which I won’t mention. It was a prestigious school, where the crème de la crème of the city sent their children to and, for some reason, my parents decided to send me there. It wasn’t a bad fit and I made some friends there and I also made my first mistake.

I met Lamisa. I knew that she was different, the first time I saw her. She was fighting with another girl in the class, a tall frightful looking girl named Humaira.

I don’t mean she was fighting with Humaira, in the way you think most girls fight. catty words and a few slaps here and there if things get absolutely out of control. No, she had Humaira’s head on the teachers table, with her fist scrunched up in Humaira’s hair. There were tears in Humaira’s eyes and Lamisa was shouting.

“Say it. Say that you crawled out of the slum.”

I rushed over to help and grabbed Lamisa’s hand. It was like grabbing a coil of live wire – the manic energy in it was intense. It was enough to loosen Lamisa’s grip though and Lamisa turned on me, a raptor ready to strike.

“Who are you?”

“My name is Samira.”

“Well good for you. What are you doing here?”

“I study here.”

“Not if I say you don’t. Prove it.”

So I showed her my ID card and she glanced at it for a moment, before she saw that the teacher had come into the room and we all hurried to our desks.

The other girls waited, watching the action. This happens more than you think in Bangladesh – we are a nation of watchers, watching and commenting on what happens instead of doing anything about it.

After the teacher had taken a good look at us and started writing on the blackboard, Lamisa came over to me.

“You’ve got balls, you know that?”

I didn’t say anything.

“Either that or you are very stupid. Move, I am going to sit down.”

So I did.

She turned around, pointed at her bag and the girl sitting behind us passed it over.

“Samira right? I’m sorry about all that. That bitch deserved it.”

“Did she?”

“Yeah she did. Don’t get smart with me. She called me a slut. What do you think about that?”

I didn’t reply.

“I had to teach her some manners. No one calls me a slut.” She said. At the time, I wasn’t even sure what that word meant but I nodded gravely.

After that strange introduction, we got to talking. The funny thing about childhood friendships is that they happen almost all at once, as though they were always there, just waiting to be found and uncovered. Each day gains the semblance of adventure and even innocuous moments, through some strange alchemy, become magical. Humorous even.

I remember once, Lamisa was mad at another girl in our class – Sharika. Sharika had said something or done something to Lamisa the year before – refused to help her during a test or something like that and Lamisa hadn’t forgotten. For the better part of a month, Lamisa would come early in the morning and fill Sharika’s water bottle – a large rotund monstrosity more befit a mountain climber than a schoolgirl - with chalk and no matter how many times Lam and I would see Sharika drink the tainted water, it would not stop being any less funny.

Lamisa had a round face – not fat exactly but falling on that side of the scale. Her hair was long and curly and stood on her head like a cloud. She had a large gap between her two front teeth. I thought that it looked cute, made her seem more accessible but she hated it. She told me later that, when she was a child, she was teased mercilessly about them by her classmates and she had to teach them to respect her because of it.

Don’t we all have stories like that in our lives – in a way, it is the things which aren’t perfect about us which shape us more than our supposed strengths. Be it the color of our skin or our height or the size of our breasts when we start getting them – all of those add up and compound as well, making us into who we are.

This cigarette is good. This is called a segue, bringing you back, from the flashback to the reality of my situation. I’m starting to feel a little lightheaded – the effects I suppose. Still it is doing nothing to mask the disgust that I feel, that I have felt every day since the videos were leaked by him, perhaps even before then. The one’s we love are always the ones who stick the knife in the deepest.

Lamisa was the girl who got me smoking in the first place.

I can remember my first cigarette. Most people can. It is terrible and it stands in stark contrast to how it will be for the rest of your life. In a way, it is like sex. The first time sucks but the more you do it, the more you realize what the hype is about.

The first time Lamisa and I smoked, it was in the fall. We had been friends for three months and that is a long term when you are thirteen years old.

Class had just ended and we were lounging in the far corner of the field at school. My parents always came to pick me up an hour after class ended. My mothers work ended at that time. Lamisa would wait with me and we would sit in the corner of the field, under a banyan tree, watching the older boys play football. To be honest, I was never a fan of the sport – I didn’t find much sense in supporting either of the teams and I still don’t. Lamisa loved the fierce competitiveness of it, of how each play and each pass was determined by the one with greater skill and greater strength and quicker wits.

We watched the game for about twenty minutes, not saying much of a word to each other. Or rather, Lamisa was watching the game. I had taken out a copy of ‘To Kill a Mocking Bird’. When we first started being friends, Lamisa would get very annoyed whenever I would read in front of her – she was of the persuasion that reading was what you did to pass in school and that was it. She never liked it when people were paying attention to something or someone else when she was in the room so I didn’t do it that often.

“Earth to Sam. Are you there?”

I poked my nose over the edge of the book and looked at her.

“Game over?”

“Oh I stopped watching after Dominic went home.” Dominic was this boy from class nine, with short hair and a thin scar on his forehead, who was Lamisa’s dazzling green light on the shore.
“Look what I sneaked out of my Mom’s bag today.” she said.

I peered in. A small white packet of cigarettes sat in the dusky gloom.

“Cigarettes? You aren’t allowed to bring them here.”

“That’s what makes it fun. Come on, we are going to smoke today.”

“No way Lam. I’m not smoking. My mother will kill me.”

“Trust me. These are mint cigarettes. My Dad doesn’t like it when my mother smokes so she smokes these. These don’t have that strong a smell. And you can cover up the rest with perfume. Trust me, you’ll like it.

She handed me one and in that late afternoon haze, the cigarette looked quite alluring. I picked it up, felt its fragile weight in my hand and gave it back to her.

“I don’t want one.”

She glared at me. “I can’t have a whole one. Let me light it and show you how easy it is.”
So she did, with the practiced air of someone who had done this thousands of times before, she lit the match with one hand and brought the flame to the tip. One small kiss and it was done. She took a dainty puff, a small gasp of air and it was done. She exhaled, the smoke coming out in a perfect ring. That moment had a movie quality with it almost. After her puff, she gave it to me and I put the butt in my mouth, inhaling the acrid smoke almost all at once.

A fusillade of coughs came over me – my lungs felt as though they were on fire, tears were coming out of my eyes and I fell on the ground, wheezing. After my fit was over, I saw Lamisa looking down at me smiling. “Welcome to the club. How’d you like your first cigarette?”
She laughed. “Come on, try it again but don’t breathe it in like that. Put it in your mouth and slowly sip the smoke, as though you are sucking a Coke through a straw.”

I did. And this time, it wasn’t that bad.

After that, we started smoking whenever we got the chance – two or three times a week after school. It was a secret shared between the two of us and that made it special. It was also a small act of rebellion against my parents. My parents weren’t dictators, if that is what you are starting to think, but they had their rules and thirteen is the time for rules to be stretched and broken. You start staying up later than you ought to, you start talking on the phone when it is study time and you smoke cigarettes with your friends without telling them. In a way, that small bit of rebellion was more about finding my own identity than fighting with my parents. If they were here now, I would apologize to them for how I’ve acted over the years but more often than not, no matter how well you write or how eloquently you speak, it is always the simple truths that are hardest to speak about.

Words diminish them.
