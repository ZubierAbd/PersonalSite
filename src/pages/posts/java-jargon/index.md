Fairly basic rundown of some Java terminology that I have all but forgotten (well not all since a lot of this stuff translates pretty one for one to Typescript and the syntactic sugar that is JS classes)

Just starting with the very basics to ease myself into this and see how much I remember

**Class**

A class describes a particular kind of object and contains related methods and data members (variables) that are inherent to that object. A class must have the same name as the file it is contained in.

Classes are used to create objects which are instances of those classes .In layman's terms this means something like the following

```
class Animal
```
